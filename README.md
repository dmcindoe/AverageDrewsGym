## Setup 


Fork then Clone this Repository.

All the Client & Trainers information can be found in the `db seed` file.

There is User information but would recommend making own using create user form to create user data.

make sure to run db:migrate db:seed after cloning and before running rails s in Terminal



Then, run `rails s` to start up server and bring up `http://localhost:3000`.


## Project Goals

Create a basic Crud App, with log in and validation aspects.

## Project Requirements

Make a full stack Ruby Application.
Project Must have full Crud Capabilities
Must be able to create users. 
Must be able to have forms that Create, Read, Edit, Update, & Destory.

## Where to Start
Upon opening http://localhost:3000 you will be brought to a login page. If you have not done so, click the link to create a new user. Once you have created a new profile for yourself, you can log in and explore the rest of the app. If you close the window, no worries, you will remain logged in until you log out.
